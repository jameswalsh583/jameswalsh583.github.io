# About Me

I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I am actively looking for a full-time position. I am particularly passionate about software engineering/development, robotics, mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications. Beyond my core computer science courses, I have pursued technical engineering coursework to build a well-rounded foundation in both computer science and engineering.

At UMass Lowell, I was active in my school's community by being a Peer Academic Tutor for Computing I, II, and III for 5 semesters. From January to August 2024, I gained industry work experience as a Firmware Engineer Co-op student at Rockwell Automation in Chelmsford, MA. I worked alongside the firmware engineering team on long-term project development and testing. A mentor and I designed and developed a low-level analyzer for debugging serial communications between two microcontrollers on the system. The analyzer provides a detailed decomposition of the data from captured messages. I also performed testing/verification of anomalies found in the firmware of the product by simulated real-world applications using an Arduino microcontroller.
