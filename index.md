# About Me

I am currently in Northeastern University's Master of Science in Robotics program. I began in Fall 2025 and expect to graduate in Fall 2027. I am interested in building reliable, real-world robotic systems; from sensor integration to control and autonomy. I have experience with firmware/embedded engineering and have built and debugged sensor-driven systems using C++/Python, ROS/ROS2, and common lab tools (oscilloscope, logic analyzer, soldering). I am looking for robotics Co-op/internship roles in autonomy/navigation, perception, and controls/state estimation.

I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I am actively looking for a full-time position. I am particularly passionate about software engineering/development, robotics, mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications. Beyond my core computer science courses, I have pursued technical engineering coursework to build a well-rounded foundation in both computer science and engineering.

At UMass Lowell, I was active in my school's community by being a Peer Academic Tutor for Computing I, II, and III for 5 semesters. From January to August 2024, I gained industry work experience as a Firmware Engineer Co-op student at Rockwell Automation in Chelmsford, MA. I worked alongside the firmware engineering team on long-term project development and testing. A mentor and I designed and developed a low-level analyzer for debugging serial communications between two microcontrollers on the system. The analyzer provides a detailed decomposition of the data from captured messages. I also performed testing/verification of anomalies found in the firmware of the product by simulated real-world applications using an Arduino microcontroller.

# Projects

This section highlights some of my academic and personal projects.

## Elbow Angle Estimation: Fall 2025

[Click here](https://github.com/PhusNguyen/Elbow-Angle-Tracking-IMUs.git) to view the repository for my Robotics Sensing and Navigation final project. For the project, I collaborated to in designing a wearable device that estimates the angle between someone’s forearm and upper using two IMU sensors with sensor fusion. I built a quaternion-based angle estimation algorithm in Python with NumPy. The algorithm used IMU quaternion data to rotate a common bone axis into the world frame and compute the elbow angle from the dot product. Lastly, I utilized the algorithm in a ROS2 node that subscribed to IMU topics and published real-time angle. View the final report for the project [here](documents/RSN_Final_Report.pdf).


## Educational Video Game: Fall 2024

[Click here](https://github.com/andrade01986219/FlashCars.git) to view the repository for my group educational video game, made in a Software Engineering course. The project was completed in a group of 4. The repository contains a description of the project, multiple versions of the code for the game, multiple versions of a software requirements specification document, software diagrams, a presentation slide show, and a demo video showing how the game works.

## DuckieBot Robotics Lab: Spring 2023

[Click here](https://github.com/jwalsh2025/lab_ducklingbot.git) to view the repository of my Fundamentals of Robotics Lab. DuckieBot is an educational robot created by [DuckieTown](https://duckietown.com/). In the packages folder of the repository, you will find three parts of the lab section of the course. Each lab folder contains a Python source code and a launch file. The first lab in the folder (lab 2) simply moves the three-wheeled robot around a track in a square. The second lab (lab 3) uses OpenCV to program the robot to follow along a track by staying in the lines of the 'road', which it does autonomously for as long as instructed. The last lab (lab 4) contains the program of a PID controller, which allowed the camera to detect an AprilTag as a 'road signs'. When a AprilTag is seen, the robot will drive to it and stop right before, simulating a stop sign.

## Computing IV Portfolio: Spring 2023

[Click here](documents/Walsh_James_Comp4Spring2023.pdf) to access my Computing IV final portfolio, showcasing each of my two-week projects completed throughout the semester. Each project was programmed in C++ using Visual Studio Code's Windows Subsystem for Linux. In the portfolio, you can find a table of contents, followed by each project in chronological order. Each project has a Discussion and Code section.
