# About Me

I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I am actively looking for a full-time position. I am particularly passionate about software engineering/development, robotics, mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications. Beyond my core computer science courses, I have pursued technical engineering coursework to build a well-rounded foundation in both computer science and engineering.

At UMass Lowell, I was active in my school's community by being a Peer Academic Tutor for Computing I, II, and III for 5 semesters. From January to August 2024, I gained industry work experience as a Firmware Engineer Co-op student at Rockwell Automation in Chelmsford, MA. I worked alongside the firmware engineering team on long-term project development and testing. A mentor and I designed and developed a low-level analyzer for debugging serial communications between two microcontrollers on the system. The analyzer provides a detailed decomposition of the data from captured messages. I also performed testing/verification of anomalies found in the firmware of the product by simulated real-world applications using an Arduino microcontroller.

# Projects

This section highlights some of my academic and personal projects.

## Self-Driving Car Decision Making: Spring 2025

[Click here](documents/AI_Final_Report.pdf) to view the final report for my Artificial Intelligence Capstone Project, and [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e7-j8IWPwWG44_PUqfATW6gOhvN5YveL?usp=sharing) to view the code. The project was completed in a group of 2. The goal of the project was to understand the trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility when choosing between a probabilistic model and a more complex non-linear model. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of images of various objects and situations seen when driving. The program takes this data and performs exploratory data analysis. Then trained and evaluated using two models, Naive Bayes and a custom neural network.

## Educational Video Game: Fall 2024

[Click here](https://github.com/andrade01986219/FlashCars.git) to view the repository for an educational video game, made in a Software Engineering course. The project was completed in a group of 4. The repository contains a description of the project, multiple versions of the code for the game, multiple versions of a software requirements specification document, software diagrams, a presentation slide show, and a demo video showing how the game works.

## DuckieBot Robotics Lab: Spring 2023

[Click here](https://github.com/jwalsh2025/lab_ducklingbot.git) to view the repository of my Fundamentals of Robotics Lab. DuckieBot is an educational robot created by [DuckieTown](https://duckietown.com/). In the packages folder of the repository, you will find three parts of the lab section of the course. Each lab folder contains a Python source code and a launch file. The first lab in the folder (lab 2) simply moves the three-wheeled robot around a track in a square. The second lab (lab 3) programs the robot to follow along a track by staying in the lines of the 'road', which it does autonomously for as long as instructed. The last lab (lab 4) contains the program of a PID controller, which allowed the camera to detect QR codes on 'road signs'. When a QR code is seen, the robot will drive to it and stop right before, simulating a stop sign.

## Computing IV Portfolio: Spring 2023

[Click here](documents/Walsh_James_Comp4Spring2023.pdf) to access my Computing IV final portfolio, showcasing each of my two-week projects completed throughout the semester. Each project was programmed in C++ using Visual Studio Code's Windows Subsystem for Linux. In the portfolio, you can find a table of contents, followed by each project in chronological order. Each project has a Discussion and Code section.
