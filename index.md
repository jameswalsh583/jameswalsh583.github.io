# About Me

I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Lowell in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I am actively looking for a full-time position. I am particularly passionate about software engineering/development, robotics, mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications. Beyond my core computer science courses, I have pursued technical engineering coursework to build a well-rounded foundation in both computer science and engineering.

At UMass Lowell, I was active in my school's community by being a Peer Academic Tutor for Computing I, II, and III for 5 semesters. From January to August 2024, I gained industry work experience as a Firmware Engineer Co-op student at Rockwell Automation in Chelmsford, MA. I worked alongside the firmware engineering team on long-term project development and testing. A mentor and I designed and developed a low-level analyzer for debugging serial communications between two microcontrollers on the system. The analyzer provides a detailed decomposition of the data from captured messages. I also performed testing/verification of anomalies found in the firmware of the product by simulated real-world applications using an Arduino microcontroller.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
